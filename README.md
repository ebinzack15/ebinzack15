# Ebin Babu Thomas 🚀

Python developer with experience in building web applications and a passion for data science. Currently learning data science techniques and applying them to real-world problems.

## Skills 🔥
- Proficient in Python and related web development technologies (e.g. Flask, Django) 🐍
- Familiar with data science tools and libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn 📈
- Strong understanding of data structures and algorithms 🧩
- Experience with SQL and database management 🗄️

## Projects 🚧
- :computer: Automatic Number-Plate Recognition (ANPR) using YOLOv4: The model localises the Licence Plate and crops it and sends it to do OCR. I have used YOLOv4 tiny and trained on a total of 2000 images for 6000 epochs. It has an accuracy of about 97 Percent on the test set.
- :robot: Head Pose Estimation using Mediapipe: This application is developed using Javascript. It used Mediapipe’s FaceMesh to get the Facial Keypoints and converts them into points in 3D space. Demo Link - https://proctoring-faffc.firebaseapp.com/
- :motorcycle: Motorcycle Helmet Detection using YOLOv4: The model detects Helmet, Non-Helmet and the entire rider+bike. If we find a person not wearing a helmet inside the entire rider+bike bounding box, the bike is sent for ANPR.
